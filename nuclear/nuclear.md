# Nuclear Preparedness

- From Cuban Missile Crisis and various published papers, most likely there would be some warning before nuclear use in a city
- Unless we have a situation that's very tense and there is a classic error - balloon triggers false alert or similar as we had with previous near-misses
- Once ONE is used it may be a very short time - hours - before 100s or 1000s are used.
- History of wargames is they almost always escalate to all-out exchange regardless of initial conditions once they breach some threshold.
- This itself could condition behaviour of those in the bunkers as they feel sucked into the inevitable.

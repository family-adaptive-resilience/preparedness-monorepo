## Iodine thyroid blocking for radiological and nuclear disasters

## Status
This is a first initial draft and I intend to refine the document over time.  Better to complete a first draft and then refine it than insist on perfection and never quite finish it.

To do - more context on why nuclear risk is elevated, which regions have the highest risk, likely sequencing of events and warning signs, what to do to prepare as regards everything else.

## Introduction and Bottom Line Upfront
The current geopolitical situation is more dangerous in relation to the possibility of escalation to nuclear war than the Cuban Missile Crisis.  There have been several near-misses: it isn't the case that the system worked but that so far we were lucky.

It is possible to survive a nuclear war.  Mutually assured destruction through massive nuclear strategic bombing of every major city is the least likely scenario and there would very likely be warnings before such a phase of escalation.

In that context then it is worth making choices today to have better options for possible future contingencies.

Fallout post nuclear war is likely to lead to radioactive iodine being taken up by the thyroid gland, with consequent risk of developing cancer.

It is cheap and convenient to protect against this by having potassium iodide supplements to hand and taking them between 2 hours before and eight hours after an anticipated event.  It won't do any good waiting for something to happen and then trying to stock up at a chemist.  Even in the event you have time, stocks are likely to be low at that point.

Potassium iodide in pharmaceutical packaging can be prescribed by a medical doctor and purchased from a pharmacy.  Pragmatically though, it is available as a nutritional supplement from many sources including online (Amazon one choice).  Bioavailable iodine is pretty much the same, but it probably makes sense to get potassium iodide - just make sure that you have a sufficiently high dose per tablet and enough of them.

Bear in mind that it is unlikely that others (friends, family, neighbours) will have undertaken much preparation should this be needed, and it might make sense if you can afford it to store inventory so that you are in a position to help others.

The dose for an adult post-exposure is 2 tablets once, although repeated exposure to radioactive iodine might require repeated doses.


### [WHO Guidance](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1091700/retrieve)

Optimal period of administration of stable iodine is less than 24 hours prior to and up to two hours after the expected onset of exposure.  It would still be reasonable to administer iodine up to eight hours after the estimated onset of exposure.  Starting with iodine later than 24 hours following exposure may yield more harm than benefit since it would prolong the biological half-life of radioactive iodine that has accumulated in the thyroid.

A single administration of an ITB agent is usually sufficient. However, repeated administration of stable iodine may be necessary in the case of prolonged (beyond 24 hours)  or repeated exposure, unavoidable ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water,  
and where evacuation is not feasible. Neonates, pregnant and breastfeeding women and  people older than 60 years, should not receive repeated ITB due to the risk of adverse effects. The following considerations should be kept in mind when administering ITB:  

- Children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women, are most likely to benefit from ITB, whereas individuals over 40 years of age are less likely to benefit from it.
- Should the supply of stable iodine be limited, priority should be given to the children and younger adults.  
 - Individuals at risk of exposure to high doses of radioactive iodine (e.g. emergency  
- Workers involved in rescue or clean-up operations) are likely to benefit from ITB irrespective of their age and should be given priority.
- People living in iodine deficient areas are more likely to be affected by exposure to  radioactive iodine. In such places, national or regional programmes targeting iodine  deficiency should be considered.

### Chemical form
Potassium Iodide (KI) is most commonly used but other forms such as potassium iodate (KIO3) are equally valid provided the dosage is adapted to contain the same amount of iodine.

### Shelf-life and physical form
Tablets packed in hermetic packaging and kept in a cool and dry place fully preserve their iodine content for at least five years.

Stable iodine can be given in either double scored tablet or liquid form.  Tablets are easier to store and distribute and are less likely to cause gastro-intestinal irritation.  Tablets can be crushed and mixed with fruit juice, jam, milk or similar.

Tablets should be stored protected from air, heat, light and moisture.

### Dosage

#### Neonates (0 - 1 month)
- 12.5mg mass of iodine
- 16 mg mass of KI
- 21 mg mass of KIO3
- 1/8 tablet containing 100mg of iodine
- 1/4 tablet containing 50 mg of iodine

#### Infants (1 month - 3 years)
- 25mg mass of iodine
- 32 mg mass of KI

- 1/4 tablet containing 100mg of iodine
- 1/2 tablet containing 50 mg of iodine

- 50mg mass of iodine
- 65 mg mass of KI
- 85 mg mass of KIO3
- 1/2 tablet containing 100mg of iodine
- 1 tablets containing 50 mg of iodine

#### Adults and adolescents (> 12 years)
- 100mg mass of iodine
- 130 mg mass of KI

### Adverse effects (WHO)

> Adverse reactions to stable iodine are rare and include iodine-induced transient hyperor hypothyroidism, and allergic reactions. Reported severe clinically relevant reactions include: sialadenitis (an inflammation of the saliva gland â€“ however, no cases  of this were reported among users of KI in Poland after the Chernobyl accident), gastrointestinal disturbances and minor rashes. There are some rare but clinically relevant reactions, e.g. in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis or hypocomplementemic vasculitis. Risk groups for such reactions include those with pre-existing thyroid disorders and  iodine hypersensitivity. In case of hypersensitivity to iodine, use of potassium perchlorate can be considered to supress iodine uptake by the thyroid gland during the time of potential exposure. The use of additives, such as colourants, should be avoided as far as possible since they may cause adverse effects (e.g. allergies).


### Timing of administration (WHO)

The optimal period of administration of stable iodine is less than 24 hours prior to, and up to two hours after, the expected onset of exposure. It would still be reasonable to administer ITB up to eight hours after the estimated onset of exposure. Commencing ITB later than 24 hours following the exposure may do more harm than benefit  
(by prolonging the biological half-life of radioactive iodine that has already accumulated in the thyroid). A single administration of stable iodine is usually sufficient. However, ithe case of prolonged (beyond 24 hours) or repeated exposure, unavoidable ingestion of contaminated food and drinking water, and where evacuation is not feasible, repeated  administration of stable may be necessary. Neonates, pregnant and breastfeeding  women and older adults (over 60 years), should not receive repeated ITB.

## Sources
Note that the dosage for an adult is 2 x 65 mg tablets.  Some supplements are measured in mcg, which is micrograms with 1,000 micrograms being 1 mg.  You will need to make sure that you buy a high-dose potassium iodide.  65 or 130 mg potassium iodide per tablet.

## Communication and Transportation - Cars

### Considerations
- large fuel capacity
- plenty of cargo space
- strong towing capacity
- strong off-road capacity
- reliable and easy to maintain
- limited number of computers, electronics and processors
- conductive metal body rather than plastic and fibreglass body panels

- Store petrol, oil, brake fluid and other items needed to keep car / motorbike running

### Car parts
- battery cables
- distributor points
- condenser
- starter motor
- fuses
- spark plugs
- snap-on ferrite cores to shield electronic wiring of all types

#### Car Models
Ideally pre-1970
- Chevy Blazer (pre-1984)
- Ford Bronco (pre-1983)
- Jeep Cherokee SJ (pre-1984)
- Jeep CJ5 (pre-1979)
- Land Rover 90/110 SUV (pre-1989)
- Toyota Hi-Lux (pre-1985)
- Toyota Land Cruiser J40 (pre-1984)
- Volkswagen Beetle (pre-1972)

#### Car - EMP hardening
- keep vehicle parked in EMP-proof garage
- ground conductive components to a single point
- do not connect vehicle to engine oil warmer that is unprotected
- route wiring closer to frame of vehicle
- install ferrite clamps over the cable ends
- make sure everything is mechanical ignition
- install surge protectors on antennas

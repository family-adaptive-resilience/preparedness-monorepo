- plenty of cargo space
- strong towing capacity
- strong off-road capacity
- reliable and easy to maintain
- limited number of computers, electronics and processors
- conductive metal body rather than plastic and fibreglass body panels

- Store petrol, oil, brake fluid and other items needed to keep car / motorbike running

- do not connect vehicle to engine oil warmer that is unprotected
- route wiring closer to frame of vehicle
- install ferrite clamps over the cable ends
- make sure everything is mechanical ignition
- install surge protectors on antennas


what are the best cars for resilience against space weather event like solar CME or EMP attack?
There are a few factors to consider when selecting a car that would be resilient against space weather events like solar CME or EMP attacks. Here are some tips to help you choose a car that would be best suited for such events:

1. Look for cars with simple electrical systems: Cars with simpler electrical systems are less likely to be affected by electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) that can damage or disable more complex systems. Older cars or those with fewer electronic features may be a better choice.
2. Choose a car with a robust engine and transmission: A car with a reliable engine and transmission will be more likely to continue running even if the electrical system is affected. Look for cars with diesel or gasoline engines, as these are less likely to be affected by EMPs than hybrid or electric cars.
3. Consider a car with a manual transmission: Manual transmissions are less reliant on electronic systems and are less likely to be affected by EMPs.
4. Look for cars with a simple wiring system: Cars with simple wiring systems are less likely to be affected by EMPs. Look for cars with fewer electronic accessories and features.
5. Consider a car with a metal body: Cars with metal bodies may be less affected by EMPs, as metal is a better conductor of electromagnetic energy than plastic or other materials.

Some car models that may be well-suited for space weather events include:

1. Toyota Land Cruiser: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known for its reliability.
2. Jeep Wrangler: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known

2. Jeep Wrangler: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known for its reliability.
3. Land Rover Defender: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known for its off-road capabilities.
4. Toyota Hilux: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known for its reliability and off-road capabilities.
5. Ford F-150: This car has a simple electrical system, a robust engine, and a manual transmission. It also has a metal body and is known for its reliability and off-road capabilities.

It's important to note that while these cars may be more resilient to space weather events, it's still important to take precautions and be prepared for any situation. It's also important to keep in mind that no car is completely immune to the effects of space weather, and it's always a good idea to have a backup plan and a well-stocked emergency kit.

To further elaborate on the topic, here are some additional factors to consider when selecting a car that would be well-suited for space weather events:

6. Ground clearance: A car with high ground clearance can help you navigate through debris and other obstacles that may be present after a space weather event.
7. Four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive: A car with four-wheel drive or all-wheel drive can provide better traction and stability on uneven or slippery surfaces, which may be present after a space weather event.
8. Durable materials: A car made with durable materials, such as steel or aluminum, can withstand the harsh conditions that may arise during a space weather event.
9. Simple electronics: A car with simple electronics may be less susceptible to electrical failures caused by space weather events.
10. Easy-to-use controls: A car with easy-to-use controls can help you focus on driving and avoid distractions during a space weather event.
11. Good visibility: A car with good visibility can help you navigate through the aftermath of a space weather event, where visibility may be reduced due to debris or other obstacles.
12. Emergency supplies: Consider a car that comes equipped with emergency supplies, such as a first-aid kit, a flashlight, and a battery-powered radio.

By taking these factors into account, you can increase your chances of surviving a space weather event and minimize the risks associated with driving during such conditions. It's important to remember that no car can guarantee complete safety during a space weather event, but by choosing a car that is well-suited for such conditions, you can reduce the risks and increase your chances of survival.

13. Navigation system: A car with a reliable navigation system can help you find your way through unfamiliar territory, which may be necessary during a space weather event.
14. Communication equipment: A car with communication equipment, such as a two-way radio or a satellite phone, can help you stay in touch with emergency services and other important contacts during a space weather event.
15. Weather-resistant materials: A car made with weather-resistant materials, such as waterproof seats and carpeting, can help protect you from the elements during a space weather event.
16. Emergency kit: Consider a car that comes equipped with an emergency kit, which may include items such as a first-aid kit, a flashlight, and a battery-powered radio.
17. Durable engine: A car with a durable engine can help you navigate through difficult terrain and harsh weather conditions during a space weather event.
18. High ground clearance: A car with high ground clearance can help you navigate through debris and other obstacles that may be present after a space weather event.
19. Advanced safety features: A car with advanced safety features, such as lane departure warning and blind spot detection, can help you avoid accidents during a space weather event.
